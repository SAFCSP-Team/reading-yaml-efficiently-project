# Parsing YAML Project
### Objective
These projects aim to practice algorithms and calculate their time and space complexity.
You are required to solve these three projects Tokenizer YAML file, Parsing YAML file, and Search for a word in YAML file. 

<hr>

### Tokenizer YAML file 
#### Objective 
The purpose of the project is to learn how to implement the tokenizer and calculate its time and space complexity

> **Tokenizer** takes a string value or file and categorizes it  based on the value of its id, string, or number. Finally, it puts the tokens' value into an array list and tokens' type into an array list.

#### Problem
You have a `yaml_cotent`  which is:
```
name: "ProjectOne"

```
You're required to read each letter in the file `yaml_cotent` and identify if the content is id , string or number.

The output should be: 
```
['name', ':', ' ', 'ProjectOne']
['id', 'colon', 'whitespace', 'string']
```


#### Qualification to pass
 - [ ] The code should run successfully.
 - [ ] The output should match the expected output.

### Parsing project
#### Problem
You're required to print the `tokenizer` content, but the output should be as the following:
```
key:name
value:ProjectOne
```

#### Implementation

#### Quaification to pass
 - [ ] The code should run successfully.
 - [ ] The output should match the expected output.

<hr>

### Search an element in the YAML file

#### Problem
You're required to build a search function that takes one parameter a string type. 

Finally, write the time complexity and space complexity of the function as a comment above the function. 

#### Implementation

#### Quaification to pass
 - [ ] The code should run successfully.
 - [ ] The time complexity and space complexity should be correct.
