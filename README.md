# Parsing YAML Project
### Objective
These projects aim to practice algorithms and calculate their time and space complexity.
You are required to solve these three projects Tokenizer YAML file, Parsing YAML file, and Search for a word in YAML file. 

<hr>

### Tokenizer YAML file 
#### Objective 
The purpose of the project is to learn how to implement the tokenizer and calculate its time and space complexity

> **Tokenizer** takes a string value or file and categorizes it  based on the value of its id, string, or number. Finally, it puts the tokens into an array list.

#### Problem
You have a YAML file `example.yml` which contains: 
```
name: "ProjectOne"

```
You're required to read each letter in the file `example.yml` and store it in an array or linked list, then print it. 

The output should be: 
```
['name', ':', ' ', 'ProjectOne']
['id', 'colon', 'whitespace', 'string']
```

#### Implementation
<!-- 1- Import the `java.nio.file.Path` and `java.nio.file.Files` to read a YAML file -->


#### Qualification to pass
 - [ ] The code should run successfully.
 - [ ] The output should match the expected output.

<hr>

### Parsing project
#### Problem
You're required to print the `tokenizer` content, but the output should be as follows:
```
key:name
value:ProjectOne
key:version
value:1
```

#### Implementation

#### Quaification to pass
 - [ ] The code should run successfully.
 - [ ] The output should match the expected output.

<hr>

### Search an element in the YAML file

#### Problem
You're required to build a search function that takes one parameter a string type. 

Finally, write the time complexity and space complexity of the function as a comment above the function. 

#### Implementation

#### Quaification to pass
 - [ ] The code should run successfully.
 - [ ] The time complexity and space complexity should be correct.
